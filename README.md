### Prerequisites:
- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- JS package manager of choice (I will be using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/))

### Install:
Clone down the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/0xhjohnson/minimal-start.git
```
Install dependencies
```
cd minimal-start
yarn
```
Start local dev server
```
yarn dev
```
Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/). The startpage is running and any changes made will reload the page on save.

### Configuration:
Modify the `frequent.json` file in the dir `./prefs` to add your preferred links and icons.
Please note:
- Specify the icon name from [feather icons](https://feathericons.com/).
- No `http` in the URL. Just specify the site and domain.
- Intended to be used with < 13 frequent links by default.
    - Can be modified by changing the `.cntr` grid class in `/src/Frequent/Frequent.svelte`.

### Building and running in production mode:
Once you are happy with your configuration, create an optimized version of your startpage and start local server via:
```
yarn build
yarn start
```
From here you could easily deploy to the web via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) or [Zeit now](https://zeit.co/).

### Deploy via Netlify:
Netlify makes it easy to host your startpage for free with the added convenience of continuous deploys from GitHub.

- Connect to your GitHub repo.
- Specify build settings.
    - Command: `yarn build`
    - Directory: `public`
- Deploy!

### Browser configuration:
The steps to set the startpage as your new tab and home page vary from browser to browser. Popular browsers are detailed below.

#### Chrome/Chromium/Brave
Currently a [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) is required to set the startpage to your new tab page. In the extension options set the redirect URL to your startpage. The default Chrome setting on startup is to open the new tab page so we are all set.

#### Firefox
Similar story for Firefox as they removed the ability to edit the new tab url. Install a [redirect url](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) extension and you are good to go.

### Usage:
Navigate to your web browser settings and set your homepage to the local server address or web URL.
